# 🌡️📖 Danish literary sentiment

This repository holds the data for comparing Sentiment Analysis methods on Danish literature - specifically fairy tales and religious hymns of the 19th century.
Our study compares human annotations to the continuous valence scores of both transformer- and dictionary-based sentiment analysis methods to assess their performance, seeking to understand how distinct methods handle the language of Danish prose and poetry.

## 🔎 What is included

- Original and modernized Danish text
- Continuous valence annotation (0-10) by human annotators (n=2-3) per sentence/verse
- Automatic annotation scores per sentence/verse (using dictionary- and transformer-based Sentiment Analysis systems)
